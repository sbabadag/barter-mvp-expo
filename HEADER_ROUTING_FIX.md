# Header Navigation Routing Fix

## Problem
The top right icons in the header were addressing wrong routes, causing navigation issues.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Original Routing Issues:
1. **Notification icon** -> `/tekliflerim?tab=received` (outside tabs)
2. **Cart icon** -> `/tekliflerim` (outside tabs)  
3. **Favorites icon** -> `/favorites` (standalone screen - this was correct)

### Tab Structure Conflict:
The app has a tab layout with:
- `(tabs)/bids` - "Tekliflerim" tab that renders `TekliflerimScreen`
- But header icons were routing to `/tekliflerim` (outside tab structure)

This caused navigation conflicts where users would navigate outside the tab structure unintentionally.

## Solution

### Fixed Routing in `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`:

**Before:**
```typescript
const handleNotificationPress = () => {
  router.push('/tekliflerim?tab=received');
};

const handleCartClick = () => {
  router.push('/tekliflerim');
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
const handleNotificationPress = () => {
  router.push('/(tabs)/bids?tab=received');
};

const handleCartClick = () => {
  router.push('/(tabs)/bids');
};
```

## Technical Details

### Navigation Flow:
1. **Notification icon (bell)** -> Now navigates to `(tabs)/bids?tab=received` (received offers tab)
2. **Cart icon (chat bubble)** -> Now navigates to `(tabs)/bids` (my offers tab)  
3. **Favorites icon (heart)** -> Still navigates to `/favorites` (standalone screen - unchanged)

### Tab Wrapper:
The `(tabs)/bids.tsx` file is a simple wrapper:
```typescript
import TekliflerimScreen from "../tekliflerim";

export default function BidsTab() {
  return <TekliflerimScreen />;
}
```

This means the `?tab=received` parameter will be properly handled by the `TekliflerimScreen` component.

## Impact
- ✅ **Fixed navigation consistency** - Icons now navigate within tab structure
- ✅ **Maintained tab state** - Users stay within the tabbed navigation
- ✅ **Preserved functionality** - Tab parameters still work for switching between "my offers" and "received offers"
- ✅ **Better UX** - Users won't lose their tab context when using header icons

## Files Modified
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Updated header icon routing handlers

## Testing
Test by:
1. Tapping the notification (bell) icon in header -> Should go to "Received Offers" tab
2. Tapping the cart (chat bubble) icon in header -> Should go to "My Offers" tab  
3. Tapping the favorites (heart) icon in header -> Should go to favorites screen
4. Verify bottom tab navigation remains active and consistent

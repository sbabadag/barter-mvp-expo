## Database Schema
Works with existing Supabase `bids` table structure:
```sql
create table bids (
  id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
  listing_id uuid references listings(id),
  bidder_id uuid references profiles(id),
  amount numeric not null,
  message text,
  status text default 'pending',
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now(),
  expires_at timestamp with time zone,
  counter_offer_amount numeric,
  counter_offer_message text
);
```

## Status Flow
```
pending â†’ accepted (deal completed)
pending â†’ rejected (offer declined)  
pending â†’ countered (seller makes counter offer)
pending â†’ expired (24h timeout)
countered â†’ accepted (counter offer accepted)
any â†’ cancelled (user withdraws offer)
```

2. **Smart Calculations**: Automatic time/price calculations
3. **Statistics**: User engagement insights
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
5. **Performance**: Optimized queries and caching

    await createOffer.mutateAsync({
      listingId: 'listing_123',
      amount: 450,
      message: 'Nakit Ã¶deme yaparÄ±m'
    });
  };

You need to update the placeholder values in `eas.json`:

```json
"submit": {
  "production": {
    "ios": {
      "appleId": "sbabadag@gmail.com",
      "ascAppId": "YOUR_APP_STORE_CONNECT_APP_ID",
      "appleTeamId": "YOUR_APPLE_DEVELOPER_TEAM_ID"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Get Your Apple Developer Information
- **Team ID**: Find this in Apple Developer portal under "Membership"
- **App Store Connect App ID**: Create your app in App Store Connect first

### 3. Build and Submit Commands

1. **Install EAS CLI** (if not installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g @expo/eas-cli
   ```

2. **Login to EAS**:
   ```bash
   eas login
   ```

3. **Build for iOS**:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform ios --profile production
   ```

4. **Submit to App Store** (after build completes):
   ```bash
   eas submit --platform ios --profile production
   ```

### 4. App Store Connect Setup
Before submitting, ensure you have:
- Created your app in App Store Connect
- Prepared app metadata (description, keywords, screenshots)
- Set up pricing and availability
- Prepared App Store screenshots for different device sizes

### 5. Environment Variables
Your `.env` file is configured with real Supabase credentials. Make sure:
- These credentials work in production
- Your Supabase database is properly set up
- All required tables and RLS policies are in place

### 6. Testing Before Submission
1. Test the production build thoroughly
2. Verify all features work with real data
3. Test on physical iOS devices
4. Ensure all third-party services (Supabase, etc.) are working

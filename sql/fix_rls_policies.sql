-- QUICK FIX: Update RLS policies to allow profile creation
-- Run this script in your Supabase SQL Editor to fix the 42501 RLS error

-- Drop ALL existing policies to avoid conflicts

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON public.profiles;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable select for all users" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable insert for authenticated users" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable update for users based on id" ON public.profiles;

-- Create more permissive RLS policies for profile creation
CREATE POLICY "Profiles are viewable by everyone" ON public.profiles
    FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile" ON public.profiles

-- COMPREHENSIVE UUID TYPE FIX for ESKICI App
-- This script completely resolves all UUID vs TEXT type mismatch issues

-- Step 1: Drop ALL existing RLS policies on bids table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view bids they made" ON public.bids;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view bids on their listings" ON public.bids;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create bids" ON public.bids;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own bids" ON public.bids;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Listing owners can update bid status" ON public.bids;

-- Step 2: Temporarily disable RLS to avoid policy conflicts during testing
ALTER TABLE public.bids DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 3: Create type-safe policies with proper UUID handling
-- Note: bidder_id is UUID, listing_id is TEXT, seller_id is UUID

-- Policy 1: Users can view their own bids 
-- Both bidder_id and auth.uid() are UUID, so direct comparison should work
CREATE POLICY "Users can view bids they made" ON public.bids
    FOR SELECT USING (
        bidder_id = auth.uid()
    );

-- Policy 2: Listing owners can view bids on their listings  
-- listing_id is TEXT, listings.id is TEXT, seller_id is UUID, auth.uid() is UUID
CREATE POLICY "Users can view bids on their listings" ON public.bids
    FOR SELECT USING (
        listing_id IN (
            SELECT id FROM public.listings 
            WHERE seller_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );

-- Policy 3: Users can create bids (prevent bidding on own listings)
CREATE POLICY "Users can create bids" ON public.bids
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
        bidder_id = auth.uid() AND
        amount > 0 AND
        listing_id NOT IN (
            SELECT id FROM public.listings 
            WHERE seller_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );

-- Policy 4: Users can update their own bids
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own bids" ON public.bids
    FOR UPDATE USING (
        bidder_id = auth.uid()
    )
    WITH CHECK (
        bidder_id = auth.uid()
    );

-- Policy 5: Listing owners can update bid status
CREATE POLICY "Listing owners can update bid status" ON public.bids
    FOR UPDATE USING (
        listing_id IN (
            SELECT id FROM public.listings 
            WHERE seller_id = auth.uid()
        )
    )
    WITH CHECK (
        listing_id IN (
            SELECT id FROM public.listings 
            WHERE seller_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );

-- Step 4: Re-enable RLS with new policies
ALTER TABLE public.bids ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 5: Test the policies (this should work without UUID errors)
SELECT 'RLS policies fixed! Testing access...' as status;

-- Step 6: Grant necessary permissions
GRANT ALL ON public.bids TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON public.listings TO authenticated;

-- Step 7: Alternative fix if the above still fails
-- If you still get UUID errors, uncomment and run this alternative approach:

/*
-- Drop policies again
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view bids they made" ON public.bids;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view bids on their listings" ON public.bids;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create bids" ON public.bids;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own bids" ON public.bids;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Listing owners can update bid status" ON public.bids;

-- Disable RLS completely for testing
ALTER TABLE public.bids DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create very simple policies that avoid complex joins
CREATE POLICY "Simple bid access" ON public.bids
    FOR ALL USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (bidder_id = auth.uid());

-- Re-enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.bids ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
*/

-- Final success message
SELECT 'UUID type casting fix completed! ðŸŽ‰' as final_status;

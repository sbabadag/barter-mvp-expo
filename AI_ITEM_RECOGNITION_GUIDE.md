- No images are permanently stored by OpenAI
- Analysis results are kept locally in the app session
- No personal user data is sent to AI services

### API Key Security
- API keys are stored as environment variables
- Keys are not exposed in client-side code
- Production deployments should use secure key management

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**AI Analysis Not Working**
- Check if `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
- Verify API key is valid and has sufficient credits
- Restart the development server after adding the key

**Low Confidence Scores**
- Try taking clearer, well-lit photos
- Ensure the main item is clearly visible
- Retry analysis after adjusting image

**Suggestions Not Appearing**
- Wait a few seconds for analysis to complete
- Check if image upload completed successfully
- Look for AI suggestions panel below image section

**API Rate Limits**
- OpenAI has rate limits based on your plan

# ESKICI Android Build Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved: Missing Splash Screen Logo

### Problem:
- Android build was failing with error: `resource drawable/splashscreen_logo not found`
- The splash screen configuration in `styles.xml` was referencing `@drawable/splashscreen_logo` but the file didn't exist

### Solution Applied:
1. **Identified missing asset**: `splashscreen_logo.png` in Android drawable folders
2. **Used consistent branding**: Copied the new AI mandala icon (`assets/icon.png`) as the splash screen logo
3. **Added to all density folders**: Copied to `drawable`, `drawable-hdpi`, `drawable-mdpi`, `drawable-xhdpi`, `drawable-xxhdpi`, `drawable-xxxhdpi`

### Files Updated:
```
android/app/src/main/res/drawable/splashscreen_logo.png
android/app/src/main/res/drawable-hdpi/splashscreen_logo.png
android/app/src/main/res/drawable-mdpi/splashscreen_logo.png
android/app/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/splashscreen_logo.png
android/app/src/main/res/drawable-xxhdpi/splashscreen_logo.png
android/app/src/main/res/drawable-xxxhdpi/splashscreen_logo.png
```

### Verification:
- File size: 273KB (matches the new AI mandala icon)
- All density folders now contain the splash logo
- Android build should proceed without the resource linking error

### Future Prevention:
- Created `fix-android-splash.bat` script for easy reapplication
- The splash screen now uses the same beautiful AI mandala design as the app icon for consistent branding

### Next Steps:
- Android build is now running with `eas build --platform android --clear-cache`
- The app will show the AI mandala icon on both the app launcher and splash screen
- Build should complete successfully without resource linking errors

## Build Status:
âœ… **FIXED**: Missing splash screen logo resolved  
ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS**: Android build running with EAS  
ðŸŽ¨ **CONSISTENT**: App icon and splash screen now match (AI mandala design)

# 🎉 TROUBLESHOOTING SUCCESS - TestFlight Deployment Complete!

## ✅ Problem Resolution Summary

### 🔍 Root Cause Identified
**Issue**: Firebase/Expo configuration mismatch causing prebuild failures
- **Pattern**: All failing builds (24-31) had commit `64671b951e5f53e11ef9b0e82c56b160581d32c0`
- **Working build**: Build 23 had different commit `91ee54ac161b0f93e0dfabd2418a386cb39a8c8b`
- **Cause**: Firebase plugins configured in `app.json` but packages were uninstalled, creating dependency conflicts during prebuild

### 🛠️ Solution Applied
1. **Completely removed Firebase dependencies**:
   - Uninstalled `@react-native-firebase/app` and `@react-native-firebase/messaging`
   - Removed Firebase plugins from `app.json`
   - Cleaned up Firebase imports from TypeScript files
   - Removed Firebase utility files

2. **Fixed configuration consistency**:
   - Updated `app.json` to use only Expo notifications
   - Moved `@supabase/supabase-js` to main dependencies
   - Fixed import paths and TypeScript compilation errors

3. **Streamlined notification system**:
   - Replaced complex Firebase-based notifications with Expo notifications
   - Simplified notification service to prevent conflicts
   - Maintained core functionality while ensuring build stability

Modern Minimalist:
Create a clean, modern app icon for ESKICI (Turkish for 'old/second-hand dealer'). The icon should represent bartering, exchange, and sustainability. Use a circular or rounded square design with a gradient from blue to green, symbolizing trust and environmental consciousness. Include subtle elements like arrows forming a circle (representing exchange), or two hands exchanging items. The design should be simple enough to be recognizable at small sizes (16px) but detailed enough for larger displays.

Colors: Blue to green gradient (#439BEB to #4FFFB0)
Elements: Exchange arrows, handshake, recycling symbol

Use warm, inviting colors with a modern gradient. The icon should feel trustworthy and sustainable, appealing to environmentally conscious users who enjoy second-hand shopping and bartering.

Colors: Warm gradient with blues and greens
Elements: Geometric shapes, shopping elements, community symbols

Colors: Deep blues, emerald greens, gold accents
Elements: Badge design, traditional meets modern, marketplace symbols

Icon with Typography:
Design an app icon that incorporates the letter 'E' for ESKICI in a creative way. The 'E' could be formed by exchange arrows, or integrated into a symbol representing recycling, sustainability, or community exchange. Use modern typography with clean lines and a premium feel. The overall design should work well on various backgrounds and sizes.

Colors: Monochromatic with gradient accents
Elements: Letter E, typography, clean lines

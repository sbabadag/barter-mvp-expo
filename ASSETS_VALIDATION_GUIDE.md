## Splash Screen Requirements ✅

Your splash screen (`splash.png`) exists.

**Apple Splash Screen Requirements:**

## Validation Commands

After installing Node.js, you can use these commands to validate your assets:

```bash
# Install sharp for image processing
npm install -g sharp-cli

# Check icon dimensions
sharp identify assets/icon.png

# Check splash dimensions  
sharp identify assets/splash.png
```

## Asset Optimization Tips

1. **Icon should be simple and recognizable** at small sizes
2. **Use consistent branding** across all assets
3. **Test on actual devices** to ensure clarity
4. **Avoid fine details** that may not render well at small sizes
5. **Use appropriate contrast** for readability

## Next Steps

1. Verify icon is exactly 1024×1024 pixels
2. Test icon visibility at various sizes
3. Ensure splash screen loads quickly
4. Prepare App Store screenshots
5. Test assets on actual iOS devices if possible

Your assets appear to be properly configured for Expo's automatic icon generation system.

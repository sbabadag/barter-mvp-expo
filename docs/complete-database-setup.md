# Complete Database Setup Guide for Barter Turkish Marketplace

## 🎯 Overview
This guide addresses all database-related errors and provides solutions for a fully functional authentication system.

## 🚨 Current Issues Being Addressed

### 1. **RLS Policy Error (42501)**
**Error:** `"new row violates row-level security policy for table \"profiles\""`

**Cause:** Supabase Row Level Security policies prevent new users from creating profiles

**Solution:** Apply the SQL in `fix_profile_policies.sql`

### 2. **Profile Not Found Error (PGRST116)**
**Error:** `"Cannot coerce the result to a single JSON object" - The result contains 0 rows`

**Cause:** User exists in auth but has no profile record due to RLS blocking profile creation

**Solution:** Enhanced error handling in auth service + database policy fix

### 3. **Authentication Fallbacks**
**Error:** Various auth errors causing fallback to mock mode

**Cause:** Database connectivity and policy issues

**Solution:** Robust fallback system (already implemented)

## 🔧 Complete Fix Instructions

### Step 1: Apply Database Policies
1. Go to [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Navigate to your project
3. Open SQL Editor
4. Copy and paste this SQL:

```sql
-- Fix RLS policies for profiles table to allow user registration
-- This fixes the "new row violates row-level security policy" error

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users can read/write their profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "public can read profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users can create their own profile" ON profiles;

-- Recreate policies with proper permissions
-- 1. Allow authenticated users to create their own profile (for registration)
CREATE POLICY "users can create their own profile"
ON profiles FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

-- 2. Allow users to read and update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "users can read/write their profile"
ON profiles FOR ALL
USING (auth.uid() = id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

-- 3. Allow public read of profiles for marketplace features (display names, etc.)
CREATE POLICY "public can read profiles"
ON profiles FOR SELECT
USING (true);
```

5. Click "RUN"
6. Verify success message

### Step 2: Test the Fix
1. Restart your app
2. Try user registration
3. Check for these success indicators:
   - ✅ No more "42501" errors
   - ✅ No more "PGRST116" errors
